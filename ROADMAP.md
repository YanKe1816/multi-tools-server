# Roadmap (Exploration Phase)

## Current Phase
This phase is for exploration and validation only.

Goal:
- Validate the architecture of "one Render service + multiple capability paths"
- Explore which small, deterministic capabilities are suitable as infrastructure-level nodes
- Observe how such capabilities may align with OpenAI review and usage expectations

## Allowed Scope
- Build small, deterministic, and testable capabilities
- Iterate quickly with low cost and low commitment
- Use feature branches for each capability

## Out of Scope (For Now)
- Commercialization
- High concurrency optimization
- Automatic testing frameworks
- Multi-service or multi-server splitting

Note:
This roadmap is temporary and will be rewritten once clear patterns and high-certainty capabilities emerge.
